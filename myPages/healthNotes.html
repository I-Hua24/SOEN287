      <h2>Food</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up, I'm pretty sure we all spent
        5 minutes learning about 5 health groups; grains, meat, vegetable, fruits,and dairy products.
        However due to so many cultural and geographic factors, the ratio between them all have been heavily debated
        across
        the world...
        However due to WHO and jp,
        we have approximate the ratio between the food groups.
        grains about a quarter
        vegetables quarter
        protein quarter
        fruits quarter
        however they're not meant to be strictly follow , 
        depending on your stool or body building goals
        one can adjust your ratios

      <h2>
        Sleep
      </h2>
      <p>
        As much as sleep number of hours have been debated there's a general guidlines that you can give yourselves but
        the real guidlines are your own past experiences.
        However if your sleeping hygiene is a huge mess, then that's ok.You can start here and then move down toward
        your own personalized routines
