        <p>
            According to <a href="https://youtu.be/SjvsfBvfyvI">ali</a>, problem with phones are:
        <ul>
            <li> it can makes you anxious</li>
            <li>increase mental health issue (referencing Jonathan's <a href="bookRec.html#TheAnxiousGeneration">The
                    Anxious Generation
                </a> and interview)</li>
            <li>it can make you procastinate</li>
            <li>increase loniness</li>
            <li> many more like reduced sleep, congnitive performance and ability to learn</li>
        </ul>
        so the solution is use blocking apps :
        <ul>
            <li>Opal (paid app)</li>
            <li>One Sec</li>
        </ul>
        use focus mode to block notifications and stuff when there's an event like a meeting etc
        reaarrange apps like put useful stuff in the front and the rest away
        try permanent greyscale
        texts.com make messaging on computer all in one instead of on the phone
        block out a time to text instead of being on it all the time and emergency contact can be given an exception
        ali block the phone from 21h to 9h so not scrolling at night nor morning
